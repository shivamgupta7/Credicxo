The given dataset contains details about organic chemical compounds including their chemical features, isomeric conformation, names and the classes in which they are classified. The compounds are classified as either ‘Musk’ or ‘Non-Musk’ compounds. The task is to build a classification model on the given data using any Deep Learning approach that you deem appropriate viz. Multi-Layer Perceptron, CNN, RNN, etc. or you could also use transfer learning approaches through selection of appropriate pre-trained model. The data has to be split in a 80:20 ratio for training and validation datasets.
